# Agile estimation card

I just want to use this small and easy site to replace the poker card estimation in agile
process(scrum or XP). Every team member scan the QR code to get into the place of only on input box,
every time we need a group estimation, every team member are required to input his/her estimation,
then we show the estimation together.

Here is the QR code:
